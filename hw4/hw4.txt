(A) True. Every float can be represented perfectly as a double because doubles have more precision than floats. 
(B) False. x = INT_MIN, y = 1
(C) True. Doubles can perfectly represent all integers up to 53 bits and no 3 integers added together will be greater than 53 bits. 
(D) False. x = 1804289383, y = 846930886, z =  1681692777
(E) False. x = 1, z = 0
